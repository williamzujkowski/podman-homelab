# Infrastructure Improvements Summary

## 🚀 Improvements Completed

This document summarizes the critical improvements implemented to enhance the Podman homelab infrastructure.

## 📊 Monitoring Enhancements

### 1. Grafana Dashboards Deployed ✅
- **Node Exporter Dashboard**: Comprehensive system metrics visualization
  - CPU, Memory, Disk, Network metrics
  - Load average tracking
  - Real-time status monitoring
- **Service Monitoring Dashboard**: Service health overview
  - Service uptime tracking
  - API response times
  - Prometheus TSDB statistics
  - Scrape success rates

Access dashboards:
- http://localhost:3000/d/node-exporter
- http://localhost:3000/d/service-monitoring

### 2. Prometheus Alert Rules Configured ✅
Implemented comprehensive alerting for:
- **Node Alerts**:
  - NodeDown (critical): Node exporter unreachable for 5m
  - HighCPUUsage (warning): CPU > 80% for 10m
  - HighMemoryUsage (warning): Memory > 90% for 5m
  - DiskSpaceLow (warning): Disk > 85% for 10m
  - HighLoadAverage (warning): Load > 4 for 5m
- **Service Alerts**:
  - PrometheusDown (critical): Service down for 2m
  - GrafanaDown (critical): Service down for 2m
  - LokiDown (critical): Service down for 2m

### 3. Loki Retention Policies ✅
Configured 31-day retention with:
- Automatic cleanup via compactor
- Rate limiting: 10MB/s ingestion
- Stream limits: 10,000 streams per user
- Storage optimization with retention deletion

## 🔒 Security & Reliability

### 4. Automated Backup System ✅
Created comprehensive backup solution:
- Daily automated backups via systemd timer
- Backs up configurations, dashboards, and data
- 7-day retention policy
- Compressed storage format

Run manually: `./scripts/backup.sh`

### 5. Production Pi Inventory ✅
Prepared for production deployment:
- 4 Raspberry Pi nodes configured
- Canary deployment strategy (pi-a first)
- Service placement mapping
- Resource allocation defined
- Time synchronization requirements per CLAUDE.md

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### 6. Container Resource Limits ✅
Optimized resource allocation:
- **Prometheus**: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- **Grafana**: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- **Loki**: 512MB RAM, 0.5 CPU
- **Node Exporter**: 128MB RAM, 0.2 CPU
- **Caddy**: Default (auto-scaled)

### 7. Grafana Alerting Configured ✅
Set up notification channels:
- Webhook endpoint for critical alerts
- Email notifications for warnings
- Alert routing and grouping rules
- Custom alert templates

## 🔧 Operational Improvements

### 8. Service Monitoring ✅
Enhanced observability:
- All services have health checks
- Prometheus scrapes all targets
- Real-time metrics collection
- Dashboard provisioning automated

### 9. Network Connectivity ✅
Addressed Multipass limitations:
- SSH tunnel script for service access
- Firewall rules properly configured
- Reverse proxy routing via Caddy
- Path-based routing configured

### 10. CI/CD Enhancements ✅
GitHub Actions workflows:
- Automated testing and linting
- Staging deployment pipeline
- Production deployment with approvals
- Security scanning integration
