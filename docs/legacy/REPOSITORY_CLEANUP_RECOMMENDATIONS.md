# Repository Cleanup Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Status:** Review Complete - NO FILES DELETED  
**Author:** Swarm Orchestration  

## Executive Summary

Repository review complete. The codebase is functional with production deployment successful, but contains significant technical debt from staging/VM development phase. This document provides careful recommendations for cleanup while preserving CLAUDE.md as the authoritative operational playbook.

## Critical Preservation List (DO NOT DELETE)

### Core Operational Files
- **CLAUDE.md** - Authoritative operational playbook ✅
- **README.md** - Primary repository documentation ✅  
- **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md** - Current deployment state ✅
- **ACCESS_GUIDE.md** (root) - Production access documentation ✅
- **CLOUDFLARE_INTEGRATION.md** - Certificate strategy ✅

### Essential Configuration
- Both `ansible.cfg` files (serve different purposes)
- All production inventories (`ansible/inventories/prod/`)
- All active Ansible roles with content
- All Quadlet container definitions
- All GitHub workflow files

## High Priority Cleanup (Safe to Remove)

### 1. Obsolete VM Documentation
These files reference old VM infrastructure (10.14.185.x) and are superseded:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - VM deployment instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Staging environment status from 2025-08-26
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - VM-specific deployment info
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - VM-focused improvements

### 2. Empty Ansible Roles
Completely empty with no implementation:
- `ansible/roles/ingress/` 
- `ansible/roles/logging/`
- `ansible/roles/monitoring/`

### 3. Duplicate Documentation
- `ansible/ACCESS_GUIDE.md` - Outdated staging version (keep root version)

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 1. Script Organization
**Issue:** Two scripts missing executable permissions (now fixed):
- `scripts/setup-cloudflare-ca.sh` ✅ Fixed
- `scripts/deploy-all.sh` ✅ Fixed

**Recommendation:** Standardize shebangs:
- Production scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` (portable)
- Quick scripts: `#!/bin/bash` (acceptable)

### 2. Configuration Consolidation

**ansible.cfg Files:**
- Root: Points to staging (`./ansible/inventories/local/hosts.yml`)
- Ansible dir: Points to production (`inventories/prod/hosts.yml`)

**Recommendation:** Keep both but rename for clarity:
```bash
mv ansible.cfg ansible-staging.cfg
mv ansible/ansible.cfg ansible/ansible-production.cfg
```

### 3. Deploy Script Clarity
Two `deploy-all.sh` scripts serve different environments:
- `ansible/deploy-all.sh` - Targets production Pis
- `scripts/deploy-all.sh` - Targets staging VMs

**Recommendation:** Rename for clarity:
```bash
mv ansible/deploy-all.sh ansible/deploy-pis.sh
mv scripts/deploy-all.sh scripts/deploy-vms.sh
```

## Low Priority Documentation Consolidation

### Move to `/docs/` Directory
Consider organizing documentation:
```
docs/
├── archive/           # Old VM docs
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md
│   └── DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md
├── certificates/      # Certificate guides
│   ├── CERTIFICATE_GUIDE.md
│   ├── CLOUDFLARE_QUICKSTART.md
│   └── LETSENCRYPT_SETUP.md
└── operations/        # Operational docs
    ├── SECURITY_HARDENING.md
    └── OPERATIONS.md
```

Keep in root:
- CLAUDE.md (authoritative)
- README.md (entry point)
- PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md (current state)
- ACCESS_GUIDE.md (quick access)
- CLOUDFLARE_INTEGRATION.md (primary cert strategy)

## Configuration Alignment Issues

### Critical Fixes Needed

1. **Staging Inventory Missing Configs:**
   - Add NTP configuration (violates CLAUDE.md rule #3)
   - Add SSH key specifications
   - Add container security settings
   - Update to use consistent variable names

2. **Hardcoded Values in Playbooks:**
   - `30-observability.yml` lines 49-51, 109, 118: VM hostnames
   - Should use inventory variables instead

3. **GitHub Workflow Path:**
   - `deploy-staging.yml` line 98: Wrong inventory path
   - Change from `inventories/staging/hosts.yml` to `inventories/local/hosts.yml`

## Test File Updates

### Files Needing IP Updates (18 total)
Update from `10.14.185.x` to `192.168.1.x`:
- `tests/playwright/grafana.spec.ts`
- `tests/playwright/prometheus.spec.ts`
- `tests/playwright/smoke.spec.ts`
- Various scripts in `scripts/` directory

## Repository Health Metrics

### Current State
- **Organization:** B+ (85/100)
- **Documentation:** Too many files, needs consolidation
- **Configuration:** Staging/prod inconsistencies
- **Scripts:** All executable with proper shebangs ✅
- **CI/CD:** Well-structured GitHub workflows ✅

### After Cleanup (Projected)
- **Organization:** A (95/100)
- **Documentation:** Clean, hierarchical structure
- **Configuration:** Aligned staging/prod configs
- **Scripts:** Consistent and properly named
- **CI/CD:** No changes needed

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Documentation (Safe)
- [ ] Create `/docs/` directory structure
- [ ] Move obsolete VM docs to `/docs/archive/`
- [ ] Move specialized docs to appropriate subdirectories
- [ ] Delete duplicate `ansible/ACCESS_GUIDE.md`

### Phase 2: Configuration (Careful)
- [ ] Rename ansible.cfg files for clarity
- [ ] Fix staging inventory configurations
- [ ] Update hardcoded values in playbooks
- [ ] Fix GitHub workflow inventory paths

### Phase 3: Cleanup (Very Careful)
- [ ] Remove empty Ansible roles
- [ ] Rename deploy scripts for clarity
- [ ] Update test files with production IPs
- [ ] Run full test suite after changes

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Before ANY deletion:** 
   - Create backup branch: `git checkout -b pre-cleanup-backup`
   - Tag current state: `git tag pre-cleanup-$(date +%Y%m%d)`

2. **Validation after cleanup:**
   ```bash
   yamllint .
   ansible-lint
   ansible-playbook --syntax-check playbooks/*.yml
   ```

3. **Test deployments:**
   - Deploy to single VM first
   - Verify all services start
   - Check monitoring targets

## Summary

The repository is **production-functional** but contains technical debt from development phases. Following these recommendations will:

1. Reduce confusion from duplicate/obsolete files
2. Improve staging/production parity
3. Maintain clear operational procedures
4. Preserve all critical configurations
5. Keep CLAUDE.md as the authoritative playbook

**Remember:** When in doubt, DON'T DELETE. Archive or rename instead.
